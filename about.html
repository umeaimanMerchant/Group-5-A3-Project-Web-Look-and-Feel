                        <li><strong>Users → Books:</strong> One user can upload many books</li>

                    </ul>

                    <li><strong>Users → Borrow Records:</strong> Each borrow record links both the borrower and the owner.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books → Reviews:</strong> Multiple users can review the same book, providing feedback and ratings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Users → Reviews:</strong> Users can write reviews for different books they have interacted with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Books → Book Images:</strong> Each book can have multiple images, with one marked as primary.</li>
                    <li><strong>Users → Preferences:</strong> Each user has a single preferences record storing favorite genres and notification settings.</li>
